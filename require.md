## Data Models

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  currentAddress: Address;
  newAddress: Address;
  serviceUpdates: ServiceUpdate[];
}
```

### Address
```typescript
interface Address {
  street: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  zipCode: string;
  country: string;
  additionalInfo?: string;
}
```

### Service
```typescript
interface Service {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: ServiceCategory;
  hasDirectAPI: boolean;
  updateMethod: 'API' | 'RPA';
  requiredFields: string[];
  automationScript?: string;
}
```

## Security Considerations
